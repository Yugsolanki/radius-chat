## About The Project

![Screen Shot](images/screenshot.png)

The aim of this project is to create a location-based chat app that enables users to connect with others who are within a certain geographical radius. The app will allow users to create chat rooms that are restricted to people within a specific location, providing a more relevant and private chat experience.

* The main challenges of the project include obtaining and updating the user's location in real-time, creating and managing chat rooms based on location and radius, filtering and displaying visible chat rooms to users, and handling user access and participation in chat rooms as they move in and out of the radius.
* The app will be developed using django and tailwind and best practices and will be optimized for mobile devices.
* Developers of all skill levels are welcome to contribute to the project.
The "Radiuschat" project aims to create a unique and valuable location-based chat app for users worldwide.

## Built With

This project was built using:

* Django: a high-level Python web framework for rapid development and clean design.
* Tailwind: a utility-first CSS framework for quickly building custom designs.
* Flowbite: a Tailwind CSS UI kit for creating responsive web applications.
* Geocoder: a Python library for getting user location data based on IP addresses.
